The US Census Bureau annually attempts to observe around 3.5 million residential addresses through the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs). This Stata take-home final exam will consider a dataset derived from the [Year 2019 ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about/forms-and-instructions/2019-form.html). These data were accessed using Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). The Census Bureau [contacted addresses](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/respond/other-ways-to-respond.html) by mail requesting that the dwellers of the residence fill out an online form. If dwellers at some address do not respond online promptly than the Census Bureau will mail a paper version of the questionnaire. Once a paper form has been ignored, the addresses may receive an in-person visit for interview from a Census Bureau employee.

All members of the US should be considered as the population of interest. The Census Bureau also wants more local data, towards offering cities counties and states vital household economic social demographic data, making for an overall regionally-representative sample.

When we derived our cross-sectional 2019 ACS data using IPUMS, we included variables with regards to house value and total household income. Our full list of selected variables includes those two as well as ownership of dwelling, annual electricity cost, annual gas cost, annual water cost, annual home heating fuel cost, multigenerational household, sex, age, race, educational attainment, employment status, total personal income, social security income, welfare (public assistance) income, interest dividend and rental income, retirement income, poverty status, and veteran status.

"ACS is monthly rolling samples of households that was designed to replace the Census long form. Nationally-representative ACS data has been available each year since 2000"

"include about 3 million households nationwide"

"The public use samples of the ACS and PRCS are extracted from the Census Bureau's larger internal data files and are thus subject to additional sampling error and further data processing (such as imputation and allocation).

The sampling unit is the household and all persons residing in the household. To protect individual confidentiality, geographic identifiers are currently restricted to the state level, and individual variables, such as income and housing values, are Top coded.

The ACS/PRCS sample design approximates the Census 2000 long form sample design and oversamples areas with smaller populations. Each month a systematic sample is drawn to represent each U.S. county or county equivalent. The selected monthly sample is mailed the ACS/PRCS survey at the beginning of the month. Nonrespondents are contacted via telephone for a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) one month later. One third of the nonrespondents to the mail or telephone survey are contacted in person for a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) one month following the CATI attempt. Weights included with the ACS PUMS for the household and person-level data adjust for the mixed geographic sampling rates, nonresponse adjustments, and individual sampling probabilities. Estimates from the ACS IPUMS samples may not be consistent with summary table ACS estimates due to the additional sampling error."

**The population of interest in our research analysis is subset of US adults: US residents age 18-64 with total housing units value below one million dollars.**

**3.** Choose **2 continuous (i.e. not dummy/binary or categorical)** variables from your dataset. You will be studying the relationship between these variables so one should be considered an outcome variable $y$ and one an explanatory variable $x_1$. Choose ones that make sense for this type of relationship. Describe both variables here in words, including what they are meant to capture, units of measurement, etc. Be clear on which is the outcome variable and which is the explanatory variable. **(2 points)**

***

$$y: valueh \text{ i.e., total home value} \\
x_1: hhincome \text{ i.e., total household income }$$

We have chosen to treat house value as outcome variable and household income as explanatory variable.

"HHINCOME reports the total money income of all household members age 15+ during the previous year. The amount should equal the sum of all household members' individual incomes, as recorded in the person-record variable INCTOT. The persons included were those present in the household at the time of the census or survey. People who lived in the household during the previous year but who were no longer present at census time are not included, and members who did not live in the household during the previous year but who had joined the household by the time of the census or survey, are included. For the census, the reference period is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, it is the previous 12 months.

Note that household income differs from family income, which is reported in FTOTINC. The family income variable only reports the incomes of household members related to the head, while HHINCOME includes the incomes of all household members."

"VALUEH reports the value of housing units in contemporary dollars."

\newpage

**4.** Provide summary statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) for your two variables described in part (3). **Calculate these summary statistics only for the sample that you use in part (6).**  This means that your sample size for each variable should match the sample size in part (6).  To do this, you first run the regression in part (6).  Then immediately after you run the regression, you use the summarize command and an “if” statement as follows:

    regress y x
    summarize y x if e(sample)==1

Be sure to display the summary statistics **in a neatly formatted table** (i.e. do NOT simply copy and paste Stata output).  **(2 points)**

**Calculate these summary statistics only for the sample that you use in part (14).**  This means that your sample size for each variable should match the sample size in part (14).  Because you are including a new variable, this may change your sample size from part(6) (and part(4))  so you may need to recalculate summary statistics even for $y$ and $x_1$. **(2 points)**

**Be sure that your table is formatted clearly, with column numbers and easily identifiable entries (e.g. no mysterious variable names).  (2 points)**

***

$$\text{ANSWER 16}$$

\newpage

Choose a **binary explanatory** variable to add to your regression from your dataset.  If you do not have a binary variable in your dataset, create one from a continuous or categorical variable.  For example, if you have data on income (continuous), use it to create a dummy variable (e.g. high or low income). Or, if you have data on school type (private, public, religious), you might create a dummy variable that is 1 for private or religious and 0 for public.
If you want, you can also have a binary dependent variable, but this is NOT required.  However, if you use a binary dependent variable, you must be careful when interpreting coefficients – specifically, you’ll need to interpret everything in terms of percentage point changes in the probability that your dependent variable is equal to 1.

\newpage

**22.** 	Create a scatterplot that shows the relationship between your dependent variable and one continuous explanatory variable, separately for when your binary variable is equal to 1 and when it is equal to 0. **Make sure your scatterplot is very clear and easy to read – it should have different markers for when your binary variable is equal to 1 and when it is equal to 0 and it should have a legend.

Hint: The Stata code might be helpful:

    twoway (scatter y x1 if x3==1) (scatter y x1 if x3==0, ms(X)), legend(label(1 "High Income") label(2 "Low Income"))
    
where $y$ is your dependent variable, $x1$ is your continuous variable and $x3$ is your binary variable.

\newpage

**23.** 	Create two linear fit plots that shows the relationship between your dependent variable and your continuous variable (the same one from part (22)), separately for when your binary variable is equal to 1 and when it is equal to 0 (but on the SAME graph).  Make sure your linear fit plots are very clear and easy to read – it should have different line styles for when your binary variable is equal to 1 and when it is equal to 0 and it should have a legend.

  For example, your code might be `twoway (lfit y x1 if x3==1) (lfit y x1 if x3==0, lp(-)), legend(label(1 "High Income") label(2 "Low Income"))` where y is your dependent variable, x1 is your continuous variable and x3 is your binary variable.

**29.** Do you think the **dependent** variable in your regression from part (28) is reported with error? Explain briefly. If you think it is measured with error, explain whether you think that measurement error will lead to bias and whether that bias will lead you to under- or overestimate the true effect. *Regardless of whether you think the measurement error causes bias*, what effect does measurement error in your dependent variable have on the precision of your estimates? **[2 points]**

$$\text{ANSWER 30}$$

\newpage

**31.** Do you think your regression estimates suffer from sample selection bias?  Explain. (For this part, do not discuss missing data.) **[2 points]**

***

$$\text{ANSWER 31}$$

\newpage

**32.**	Do you have missing data for any of the observations in your regression sample?  Do you think the data are missing at random? Will the missing data cause bias? **[2 points]**

To help see whether the data are missing at random (and thus whether or not the missing data are likely to cause bias), create a dummy variable that is equal to 1 when data is missing and that is 0 when the data are not missing (for each variable in your regression).  Then regress that dummy variable on other explanatory variables. 

For example, if you have data on income, age, and race, you would create the following dummy variables:

    gen missing_inc = (income==.)
    gen missing_age = (age==.)
    gen missing_race = (race==.)

and then you would regress each of those on the other variables, e.g.

    reg missing_inc age i.race

If income is (statistically significantly) more likely to be missing for older (or younger) people or for people of a specific race, then the data are not missing at random and will likely cause bias. (Clearly this will only be helpful for observations where you have missing values for some but not all variables.)

Note: in order to show your results concisely, use the outreg2 command.  Continuing the example above, this would mean doing the following:

    reg missing_inc age i.race
    outreg2 using missingdata, bdec(3) word excel replace 
    reg missing_age i.race income
    outreg2 using missingdata, bdec(3) word excel append 
    reg missing_race age income
    outreg2 using missingdata, bdec(3) word excel append

Variable: "COSTELEC"

Name:	COSTELEC

Label:	Annual electricity cost

Variable Text:	COSTELEC for 1970 reports each rented housing unit's annual electricity cost, excluding amounts included with contract rent payments. For later years, COSTELEC gives the annual electricity cost for each housing unit (rented or owned), again excluding amounts included in contract rent or other types of payments. For 1970 and 1980, units within the universe that used no electricity can be identified. Beginning in 1990, the form combines the categories "no charge" and "no electricity used."

COSTELEC amounts for renters are part of RENTGRS. Census Bureau research comparing respondents' reported costs with utility company records indicates that respondents tend to overstate their costs.

In 1970, the universe for the U.S. Census samples specifies renter-occupied units rented for cash rent, not one-family houses on 10+ acres and not group quarters; however in the Puerto Rican census of 1970, this specification is for renter-occupied units rented for cash rent, not one-family houses on 3+ cuerdas, and not group quarters.

Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors). The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note:

The traditional unit of land area in Puerto Rico is the cuerda. The cuerda is equal to about 3930 square meters, 4700 square yards, or 0.971 acres. Because the cuerda and the acre are so close to being equal, they are often treated informally as being equal. Mainlanders sometimes call the unit the "Spanish Acre." The IPUMS has preserved the units for the mainland U.S. as acres and Puerto Rico as cuerdas.

Variable: "HHINCOME"

Name:	HHINCOME

Label:	Total household income

Variable Text:	HHINCOME reports the total money income of all household members age 15+ during the previous year. The amount should equal the sum of all household members' individual incomes, as recorded in the person-record variable INCTOT. The persons included were those present in the household at the time of the census or survey. People who lived in the household during the previous year but who were no longer present at census time are not included, and members who did not live in the household during the previous year but who had joined the household by the time of the census or survey, are included. For the census, the reference period is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, it is the previous 12 months.

Note that household income differs from family income, which is reported in FTOTINC. The family income variable only reports the incomes of household members related to the head, while HHINCOME includes the incomes of all household members.

Amounts are expressed in contemporary dollars, and users studying change over time must adjust for inflation (See INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors). The exception is the ACS/PRCS multi-year files, where all dollar amounts have been standardized to dollars as valued in the final year of data included in the file (e.g., 2007 dollars for the 2005-2007 3-year file). Additionally, more detail may be available than exists in the original ACS samples.

User Note: ACS respondents are surveyed throughout the year, and amounts do not reflect calendar year dollars. While the Census Bureau provides an adjustment factor (available in ADJUST), this is an imperfect solution. See the ACS income variables note for further details.

Variable: "VALUEH"

Name:	VALUEH

Label:	House value

Variable Text:	VALUEH reports the value of housing units in contemporary dollars. For 1930, 1940, and from 2008 onward, VALUEH is a continuous variable. The other years report the midpoint of an interval; see codes and frequencies for intervals.

User Note: Universe shifts and changing methods of determining value complicate use of this variable for comparisons across years. Furthermore, dollar amounts were intervalled differently for each year, and the top codes changed. Users must adjust for the effects of inflation; see INCTOT for Consumer Price Index adjustment factors.
